# Ink Runtime for Rust

Attempts to be a direct translation of the official C# implementation of the [Ink runtime](https://github.com/inkle/ink) 
to Rust.

Very much a work in progress. It is not intended that this library becomes used in place of the original, and provides no
guarantees that behaviour will be exactly the same in all cases as the original. It is aiming to be a "good enough"
implementation for personal projects.
